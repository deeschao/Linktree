ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENTS
A Good Accomplishment Statement Should Contain:
1) An action verb describing role and/or responsibilities
2) The scope of activities (i.e. size of unit managed, size of budget managed, or a number of personnel affected)
3) The results of activities, given in measurements such as, numbers/percent, amount of money, or value-added for customers
4) Specific skills gained from the experience
Tips for Writing Effective Accomplishment Statements:
 Tailor statements to company and job of interest
 Use approximately 2-5 statements for each position
 Bulleted action statements are much easier and quicker to read then paragraphs
 Use indenting where appropriate to signify points that are a subset of an accomplishment
Examples:
 Initiated advanced assembly procedures to increase production 15% by reducing turnaround time from six to five days
 Led a team of volunteers in planning, preparing, and serving a weekly meal for 90 residents at a local shelter
 Coordinated a community event for 150 individuals that resulted in $1000 collected for the New York Disaster Relief Fund-->
